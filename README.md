# **Tablique** 🕒🍽️  

Tablique is your go-to table booking app that combines sleek design with powerful functionality. Whether you're planning a lunch date or a family dinner, it’s got your back with seamless booking and real-time availability updates.  

### **What's the deal?**  
- **Timeline View**: Pick a date, and bam! See all the time slots for that day laid out like a timeline. Available slots are *green*, booked ones are *red*. Simple, right?  
- **Smart Calendar**: Forget those endless scrolling calendars. You can only pick dates from today up to 15 days in the future. Past dates? Totally grayed out.  
- **Super Validations**: Every click is validated to make sure you can’t break the system (even if you try 😜).  
- **Delete Bookings**: Change of plans? No problem. Just delete your booking with a click—clean and hassle-free.  

### **Tech Stack ⚙️**  
- **Frontend**: Next.js (because fast is fun 🚀).  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js (handling your requests like a pro).  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (because your data deserves reliability).
